DocumentationMaker is a project for creating .html files mirroring folders' states.
It was made specifically for datasheet collection with many nested folders. 

To run, change paths in *DocSettings.py* and then run *DocMaker.py*. It will prompt you to add short description to each readeable file, and you can change it later with *DocEditor.py*.
